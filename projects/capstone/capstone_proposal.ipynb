    "__Abstract__: In recent decades, scientists have studied the deforestation patterns using satellite data, and indicate that Amazon rainforest deforestation is rapidly accelerating. Kaggle together with Planet, designer and builder of the worldâ€™s largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites, hold a competition to apply satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest. The labeld satellite image chips are provided by Planet and its Brazilian partner SCCON, I will develop an algorithm to classify the image using what I have learned in Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program."
